# Nutrition and Health Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project offers a comprehensive analysis of nutrition, physical activity, and obesity data, drawing insights from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and other nutritional data sources. Utilizing a combination of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and machine learning modeling, the project aims to uncover patterns and predictions related to health and nutrition.

## Contents

- `Nutrition.ipynb`: Focuses on the preprocessing and exploratory data analysis of nutrition data. Includes data cleaning, visualization, and initial statistical analyses.

- `Nutrition1.ipynb`: Advances into machine learning, developing and evaluating models to predict outcomes based on nutritional data. Covers models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors.

- `Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.ipynb`: An in-depth analysis using BRFSS data to explore the interconnections between nutrition, physical activity, and obesity. Incorporates advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques.
